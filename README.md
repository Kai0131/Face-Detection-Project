# Face Deteaction Project
A project done with two other members for my Aritifical Intelligence course.
In this project, we 
* compared the accuracy and false-positive rate of two most widely-used algorithms for face dtection, the classic Viola-Jones face detection algorithm and Convolutional Neural Networks,
* implement an image preprocessing method to reduce false-positive rate using color selecting and sharpening, see Preprocess.py for more details.

An example of our method:
